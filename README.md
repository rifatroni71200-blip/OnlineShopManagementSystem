The Online Shop Management System is a comprehensive desktop-based software application designed to provide small to medium-sized businesses with an efficient tool for managing their day-to-day sales and inventory operations. In a competitive retail environment, accurate tracking of products, orders, and customers is crucial for success. This project aims to solve these challenges by creating a robust and user-friendly system.
Developed using C# with Windows Forms, the application provides a clean graphical user interface for employees. It connects to a secure Microsoft SQL Server database to ensure data integrity and persistence. The system is built with a clear separation of roles, providing different levels of access and functionality for 'Admin' and 'Staff' users, which enhances security and operational efficiency.
